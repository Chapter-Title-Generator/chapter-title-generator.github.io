This is the first website I've ever made. It's labelled as a generator, but it's more of a random selection from a preset collection. 

The collection is built from various video games, with the source displayed in the form of the game's logo.

There's also a Music Box with some music selections from the featured games to provide background noise.

There is a 'See All' page to be able to view every possible option for the random selection.
